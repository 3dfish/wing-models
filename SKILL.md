# OpenRouter Wingmen

This skill packages a repeatable OpenRouter conversation workflow with a unified dual-channel syntax.

## Unified Channel Protocol

At any turn, parse user text by the `==...==` rule:

- Content inside `==...==` is the third-party model segment and must be sent to OpenRouter.
- Content outside `==...==` is assistant-local segment and must never be forwarded to OpenRouter.
- If no complete `==...==` pair exists, treat the whole message as assistant-local only and do not call OpenRouter.
- If at least one complete pair exists but the merged inside content is empty after trim, do not call OpenRouter.

Execution flow:

1. Resolve alias for this call (explicit alias first, otherwise default alias).
2. Extract and merge all complete `==...==` segments as OpenRouter prompt body.
3. Send only merged inside content to OpenRouter.
4. Print OpenRouter reply immediately in chat.
5. Handle outside content locally as assistant instructions.

## Alias Credential Set (Mandatory)

- Do not use a single `OPENROUTER_API_KEY + OPENROUTER_MODEL_ID` pair.
- Use required 3-step interactive profile input: `alias -> apikey -> modelid`.
- For every credential entry (including the first one), collect `alias`, `apikey`, and `modelid` one-by-one in chat.
- Never auto-fill first-entry `alias`/`modelid` from template defaults.
- `note` is optional and may be left empty; accept `skip` / `跳过` / `-` as empty note when chat UI cannot send blank messages.
- At least one profile entry must exist.
- Store profiles in `.3rd.env` as `OPENROUTER_PROFILE_SET`.
- Use `OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_ALIAS` as fallback alias.
- Legacy `alias:key:model` text format is not supported.
- On first non-interactive run (when `<cwd>/.3rd.env` does not exist), require explicit `--alias`; do not silently fall back to `default`.

If no profile set exists and the script is interactive, prompt user to enter profile entries.

When an agent needs to create `.3rd.env` directly after collecting fields in chat, use this structure:

```env
OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_ALIAS=<default-alias-from-chat>
OPENROUTER_PROFILE_SET=[{"alias":"<alias-from-chat>","apiKey":"<api-key-from-chat>","modelId":"<model-id-from-chat>","note":""}]
OPENCLAW_AGENT_PROFILE=github-copilot
```

## Multi-Agent Compatibility

- The script supports `--agent` profiles for runtime identification only.
- Supported profiles: `github-copilot`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex-cli`, `generic`.
- Interaction must stay consistent across all agents: use chat/text input only.
- Do not rely on popup/card UI or agent-specific interaction widgets.

## Output Contract

- Save outputs directly under `<cwd>/`.
- Dialogue outputs: `*-dialogue.md` (question + answer; attachment sections record paths only)
- Attachment outputs: `*-attachment-<n>.<ext>` files
- Credentials file: `<cwd>/.3rd.env`
- Always print OpenRouter reply immediately in chat.

## Security Rules (Mandatory)

- Never print API keys in chat or terminal logs.
- Prefer interactive/env-based profile setup over command-line key arguments.
- If credentials are missing, collect in chat and persist to `.3rd.env` with restrictive permissions.

## Large File Authorization (Mandatory)

Before reading saved OpenRouter output files (`.md` or attachments):

- If file size is greater than 50KB (51200 bytes), ask user authorization in chat first.
- If user refuses/skips, do not read content; only report path and size.

## Required Assets

- Script: `./scripts/openrouter_capture.mjs`
- Package: `./scripts/package.json`
- Dependency: `@openrouter/sdk`
- Dependency: `dotenv`
- Credential template: `./.3rd.env.template`
- Agent profile config: `./scripts/agent-profiles.json`
- Channel protocol spec: `./references/protocol.md`
- Agent compatibility reference: `./references/agent-compatibility.md`
- Regression checklist: `./references/regression-checklist.md`

## Run Template

Install once:

```bash
npm install --prefix <skill-dir>/scripts
```

Call template:

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/openrouter_capture.mjs \
  --alias <alias> \
  --prompt "<user-prompt>" \
  --agent <agent-profile>
```

Long prompt template:

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/openrouter_capture.mjs \
  --alias <alias> \
  --prompt-file <path-to-prompt.txt> \
  --agent <agent-profile>
```

With attachment input (repeatable):

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/openrouter_capture.mjs \
  --alias <alias> \
  --prompt "<user-prompt>" \
  --attachment <path-or-url> \
  --agent <agent-profile>
```

## Reliability Notes

- For long prompts, prefer `--prompt-file` over shell heredoc/complex quoting.
- Treat terminal-rendered body as preview only; use `[TEXT_FILE]` path as source of truth for full output.
- If output seems cut off, inspect the saved file first, then request continuation in a follow-up call.
- Check `[ROUTE]` marker for provider/alias/model decisions when debugging.

## Completion Checks

- `==...==` channel parsing is applied correctly.
- Alias selected correctly (arg or default).
- OpenRouter reply printed immediately.
- No API key exposed in logs.
- Large-file consent requested when needed.
- Agent consistency check passes: `node ./scripts/openrouter_capture.mjs --check-agent-consistency`.
